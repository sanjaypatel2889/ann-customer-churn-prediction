To explicitly ensure `scikit-learn` recognizes the `KerasClassifier` as a classifier, I will directly set the `_estimator_type` attribute on the `model` instance after initialization.

This usually means `scikit-learn`'s `get_tags` function is trying to access `__sklearn_tags__` in the class hierarchy, and the current `KerasClassifier` setup is not providing it in the expected way. To directly resolve this, I will explicitly define and add a `__sklearn_tags__` method to the `KerasClassifier` instance, which will allow `scikit-learn` to correctly identify it as a classifier.\n",

        "The persistent `AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute '__sklearn_tags__'` indicates that `GridSearchCV`'s introspection for the estimator type is failing, even after multiple attempts to define or override `__sklearn_tags__` through subclassing or instance methods. This suggests a deeper incompatibility or an issue with how `scikeras.wrappers.KerasClassifier` is constructed, where `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`'s internal `__sklearn_tags__` method is being invoked and failing its `super()` call. A more robust solution is to directly patch the `__sklearn_tags__` method onto the `scikeras.wrappers.KerasClassifier` class itself, ensuring that all instances of `KerasClassifier` (or its subclasses) will use this fixed method during `scikit-learn`'s introspection.\n",

To bypass this problematic `__sklearn_tags__` method entirely, I will explicitly set the `_estimator_type` attribute directly on the `scikeras.wrappers.KerasClassifier` class before instantiating the model. This is a robust workaround because `scikit-learn`'s `is_classifier` function checks for `_estimator_type` before attempting to use `get_tags`, thereby preventing the problematic `__sklearn_tags__` call.\n",
